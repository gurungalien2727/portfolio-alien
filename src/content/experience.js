    description:
      `In summer 2021, joined Shipt's Talent Captain Squad and Member App team. Talent Captain Squad was a team of 5 members responsible for building an in-house recruiting web application called Talent Captains for recruiters and interviewers. This app is used for effectively scheduling interviews, planning and tracking interview panels, availability of interviewers and candidates. I built UI components using Typescript in Next.js and consumed GraphQL API using Apollo Client. I was also a part of Shipt's Member App team of 17 members where I wrote and fixed end-to-end tests for the Shipt Member App using Detox framework and improved the tests passing rate from 80% to 92%.`,
